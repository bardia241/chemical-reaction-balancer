# Chemical Reaction Balancer

## Overview

The **Chemical Reaction Balancer** is a Python tool designed to automatically balance chemical reactions. It works by taking an unbalanced reaction in the form of `reactants -> products` and returns the balanced version. This tool uses systematic methods including linear algebra to ensure the balance of elements on both sides of the reaction.

## Features

- Supports balancing reactions with multiple reactants and products.
- Handles complex compounds and correctly calculates coefficients.
- Provides an interactive mode for continuous input and output.
- Simplifies coefficients to the smallest whole numbers.

## Usage

To use the Chemical Reaction Balancer, clone the repository and run the Python script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bardia241/chemical-reaction-balancer.git
cd chemical-reaction-balancer
python chemical_reaction_balancer.py
